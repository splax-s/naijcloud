- **High**: 1-2 weeks, complex implementation with multiple dependencies

## Acceptance Criteria Framework

Each feature must include:
1. **Functional Requirements**: What the feature must do
2. **Performance Requirements**: Response times, throughput, etc.
3. **Security Requirements**: Authentication, authorization, data protection
4. **Testing Requirements**: Unit tests, integration tests, load tests
5. **Documentation Requirements**: API docs, user guides, runbooks
6. **Monitoring Requirements**: Metrics, alerts, dashboards

## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks
1. **Database Performance**: PostgreSQL query optimization for analytics
2. **Cache Consistency**: Distributed cache invalidation across regions
3. **TLS Certificate Management**: Automated certificate provisioning at scale
4. **DNS Propagation**: Managing DNS changes for traffic routing

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Database**: Implement read replicas, query optimization, proper indexing
2. **Cache**: Use Redis cluster, implement cache versioning
3. **TLS**: Use cert-manager with multiple ACME providers
4. **DNS**: Implement DNS health checks, gradual traffic shifting
