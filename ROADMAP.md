## Immediate Next Steps (This Week)

### Option A: Production Deployment Focus
1. **Set up cloud infrastructure** (AWS/GCP/Azure)
2. **Deploy to staging environment** with real domain
3. **Configure monitoring and alerting** for production
4. **Run comprehensive load testing** with realistic traffic

### Option B: Advanced Features Focus  
1. **Implement multi-tenancy** with user accounts
2. **Add image optimization** and content compression
3. **Expand edge locations** to multiple regions
4. **Create advanced analytics** dashboards

### Option C: Developer Experience Focus
1. **Build SDK libraries** for popular languages
2. **Create comprehensive CLI tools** 
3. **Implement webhook system** for integrations
4. **Add GraphQL API** for flexible queries

## Technical Debt & Maintenance

### High Priority
- [ ] Database migration system for schema changes
- [ ] Automated backup and disaster recovery
- [ ] Performance optimization based on profiling
- [ ] Memory leak detection and prevention

### Medium Priority  
- [ ] Code coverage improvement (target: 90%+)
- [ ] Documentation updates and API reference
- [ ] Dependency updates and security patches
- [ ] Refactoring for better modularity

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Uptime**: 99.9% availability target
- **Performance**: <100ms API response time (95th percentile)
- **Scalability**: Handle 10,000+ requests/second
- **Quality**: 90%+ test coverage, zero critical security issues

### Business Metrics
- **Time to Market**: Production deployment within 4 weeks
- **Developer Experience**: SDK adoption and API usage growth
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Support ticket resolution time <24h
- **Revenue**: Usage-based billing implementation

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Scaling Challenges**: Database and cache performance under load
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Proper authentication and authorization
- **Data Loss**: Backup and disaster recovery procedures
- **Compatibility**: API versioning and backward compatibility

### Mitigation Strategies
- Comprehensive load testing before production
- Security audits and penetration testing
- Automated backup testing and recovery procedures
- API versioning strategy and deprecation timeline

## Decision Points

**Which phase should we prioritize next?**

1. **Production Deployment** - Get real users and validate market fit
2. **Advanced Features** - Differentiate from competitors with unique capabilities  
3. **Developer Experience** - Focus on adoption and ease of integration

**Recommendation**: Start with **Production Deployment** to validate the platform with real users, then iterate based on feedback and usage patterns.
