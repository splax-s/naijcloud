```

### 📊 System Health
- **All Docker services**: UP and HEALTHY
- **Control Plane**: 5/5 integration tests passing
- **Edge Proxy**: 13/13 integration tests passing  
- **Dashboard**: All pages rendering successfully
- **Database**: PostgreSQL healthy with proper schema
- **Cache**: Redis operational across both databases
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus collecting metrics, Grafana dashboards available

### 🚀 Ready for Next Phase

## 📋 Next Steps: Phase 3 - API Integration & Authentication

### Immediate Priorities (Next 1-2 days):

1. **Real-time Dashboard Integration**
   - Connect dashboard to live Control Plane APIs
   - Implement data fetching with SWR or React Query
   - Add real-time updates for metrics and node status
   - Replace mock data with actual API responses

2. **Authentication System**
   - Implement NextAuth.js for dashboard authentication
   - Add JWT-based API authentication for backend services
   - Create login/logout flows and session management
   - Implement role-based access controls

3. **API Client Implementation**
   - Create TypeScript API client for Control Plane
   - Implement proper error handling and loading states
   - Add optimistic updates for better UX
   - Handle WebSocket connections for real-time data

### Medium-term Goals (Next 1-2 weeks):

4. **Production Deployment Pipeline**
   - Create Kubernetes manifests for all services
   - Implement Helm charts for easy deployment
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
   - Configure production database and Redis cluster

5. **Security Hardening**
   - Implement TLS/SSL certificate management
   - Add input validation and sanitization
   - Configure rate limiting and DDoS protection
   - Set up security monitoring and alerts
